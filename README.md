# UIVolume Class Documentation

The `UIVolume` class is responsible for managing UI states within a Unity environment. It implements the `IStateMachine` interface and provides methods for state loading, transitioning, and execution.

## Class Overview

The `UIVolume` class manages UI states and transitions, allowing for dynamic UI behavior. It handles the loading of states, executing state logic, and handling transitions between states. The class provides methods to interact with states, such as entering, exiting, and executing them.

## Public Methods

- `IState GetState(string id)`: Retrieves a state based on its ID.
- `void LoadState(string id, Action<IState> onStateLoad)`: Loads a state based on its ID and invokes the specified callback when the state is loaded.
- `void Entry(IState state)`: Sets the specified state as the current state and triggers its entry logic.
- `void Transition(ITransition transition)`: Initiates a transition to the specified state.
- `void AnyTransition(IState state)`: Enters an "any" state, which runs in parallel with the current state.
- `void ExitAnyStates()`: Exits the current "any" state, if any.
- `void StatesExecution()`: Executes the logic of the current state and any "any" states.
- `void Exit(IState state)`: Exits the specified state.

## Properties

- `bool isTransiting`: Gets a value indicating whether a state transition is in progress.

## Private Methods

- `IEnumerator TransitionTo(ITransition transition)`: Coroutine method that handles the transition process from the current state to the target state.

Please note that the `UIVolume` class also includes private fields and a private `Awake()` method, which initializes the class and sets up the states. These private members are not intended to be directly accessed from external code.
